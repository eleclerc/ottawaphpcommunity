# ToDo

- add a `next/future event` that is pooled from the database
- `script/fetchContent.php` should accept argument to get only certain type of content
- add a real `about` page with a contact form
- give _weight_ to keywords, a blog post about a cool _wordpress_ design should not appear as it's not developer related
